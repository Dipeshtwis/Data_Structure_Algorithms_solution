#Question

QuickSort1

The first step of Quicksort is to partition an array into two parts.

Challenge
Given an array 'array' and a number 'p' in the first cell in the array, can you partition the array so that all elements greater than 'p' are to the right of it and all the numbers smaller than 'p' are to its left?
For example, if given the following as input:

4 5 3 9 1

The first number 4 is the pivot, so you should put the smaller numbers to the left, and the larger to the right, and output:

3 1 4 5 9

The array should otherwise remain in the same order.

Can you write code to partition an array?

Example
p partition([4, 5, 3, 9, 1])
# => [3, 1, 4, 5, 9]


#Solution

def partition(array)
  i = 0
  ar = []
  while (i  < array.length)
    ar.push(array[i]) if array[i] < array[0]
    i += 1
  end
  ar.push(array[0])
  i = 0
  while (i  < array.length)
    ar.push(array[i]) if array[i] > array[0]
    i += 1
  end
  ar
end
