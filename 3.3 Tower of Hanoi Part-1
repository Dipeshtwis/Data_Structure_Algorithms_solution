#Question

You will be given two numbers (from 1 to 3) as input - the starting  peg, and the goal peg. Write a function that calculates how to move 2  disks from the starting peg to the goal peg. Return a string with all the steps.


Output Format:

Add the peg to move from, an arrow "->", and the peg to move to.  For example, to move from peg 1 to peg 3, print "1->3". 


Examples

move(1, 3)
# => 1->2 1->3 2->3

move(2, 3)
# => 2->1 2->3 1->3


#Solution

#Ruby

def move(starting, goal)
  a =""
  mid = ([1, 2, 3] - [starting, goal]).first
  a << "#{starting}->#{mid}" + " "
  a << "#{starting}->#{goal}" + " "
  a << "#{mid}->#{goal}"
end

#Model Solution

def move(starting, goal)
  intermediate = (1..3).find { |n| n != starting && n != goal }
	"#{starting}->#{intermediate} #{starting}->#{goal} #{intermediate}->#{goal}"
end
